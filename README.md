# Scaffold Stellar Frontend

_To get started with Scaffold Stellar, visit its repo: [github.com/AhaLabs/scaffold-stellar](https://github.com/AhaLabs/scaffold-stellar)._

_Under active development._

A modern, up-to-date toolkit for building Stellar smart contract frontends.

- ⚡️ Vite + React + TypeScript
- 🔗 Auto-generated contract clients
- 🧩 Example components for contract interaction
- 🛠 Hot reload for contract changes
- 🧪 Easy local/testnet deployment

This is the starter frontend generated by `stellar scaffold init`. See more at [Scaffold Stellar](https://github.com/AhaLabs/scaffold-stellar).

## Requirements

Before getting started, make sure you’ve met the requirements listed in the [Soroban documentation](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started/setup) and that the following tools are installed :

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) (comes with Rust)
- Rust target: install the compilation target listed in the [Soroban setup guide](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started/setup)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) (v22, or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): Comes with the node installer or can also be installed package managers such as Homebrew, Chocolatey, apt, etc.
- [Stellar CLI](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core)
- [Scaffold Stellar CLI Plugin](https://github.com/AhaLabs/scaffold-stellar)

## Quick Start

To get started with a fresh Scaffold Stellar project, follow the steps below:

1. Initialize a new project:

```bash
stellar scaffold init my-project
cd my-project
```

2. Set up your development environment:

```bash
# Copy and configure environment variables like network and STELLAR_SCAFFOLD_ENV
cp .env.example .env

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install
```

Have a look at `environments.toml` for more fined-grained control.

3. Start development environment:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the server URL in your web browser. 

4. For testnet/mainnet deployment:

When you are ready for testnet, you need to deploy your contract using
`stellar registry`. Some commands to get you started.

```bash
#  Note --source-account argument is omitted for clarity

# First publish your contract to the registry
stellar registry publish

# Then deploy an instance with constructor parameters
stellar registry deploy \
  --deployed-name my-contract \
  --published-name my-contract \
  -- \
  --param1 value1

# Can access the help docs with --help
stellar registry deploy \
  --deployed-name my-contract \
  --published-name my-contract \
  -- \
  --help

# Install the deployed contract locally
stellar registry create-alias my-contract
```

## Scaffold Initial Project Structure

When you run `stellar scaffold init`, it creates a frontend-focused project structure with example contracts:

```
my-project/                      # Your initialized project
├── contracts/                   # Example smart contracts
├── packages/                    # Auto-generated TypeScript clients
├── src/                         # Frontend React application
│   ├── components/              # React components
│   ├── contracts/               # Contract interaction helpers
│   ├── debug/                   # Debugging contract explorer
│   ├── hooks/                   # Custom React hooks
│   ├── pages/                   # App Pages
│   ├── App.tsx                  # Main application component
│   └── main.tsx                 # Application entry point
├── target/                      # Build artifacts and WASM files
├── environments.toml            # Environment configurations
├── package.json                 # Frontend dependencies
└── .env                         # Local environment variables
```

This template provides a ready-to-use frontend application with example smart contracts and their TypeScript clients. You can use these as reference while building your own contracts and UI. The frontend is set up with Vite, React, and includes basic components for interacting with the contracts.

## Stellar Tea Game Suite

This branch extends the scaffold with a full on-chain economy for **Stellar Tea**, a Play-to-Earn tea blending experience on Soroban.

- **Tokens**
  - `contracts/tokens/balls` — utility token (BALLS) with fixed initial supply `100_000_000_000 * 10^8`, admin-controlled mint/burn, and transfer helpers.
  - `contracts/tokens/stars` — premium token (STARS) mirroring the same SEP-41 surface with a reduced supply (`10_000_000_000 * 10^8`).
- **NFT Collection**
  - `contracts/nft-tea` — enumerable and burnable tea NFTs with rich metadata (flavor profile, stats, genealogy). An admin can delegate a game operator that mints, upgrades, updates lineage, and orchestrates burns for crafting.
- **Core Gameplay**
  - `contracts/game` — orchestrates all game mechanics: crafting, marketplace escrow, daily rewards, event stakes, deflationary burns, and daily limits. It coordinates cross-contract calls with the token and NFT contracts via helper utilities.

Key gameplay flows:

1. **Mixing Offers** — players post mix offers storing escrowed NFTs/Tokens; partners accept to trigger `mix_tea`, burning inputs, minting upgraded blends, paying treasury shares, and compensating participants.
2. **Upgrades** — STARS/BALLS are consumed to level an existing tea NFT while updating its metadata and stats.
3. **Marketplace** — custodial listings priced in BALLS or STARS with configurable fee/burn splits and automatic escrow handling.
4. **Engagement Loops** — daily claims with per-user limits, event staking with pooled redistribution, and opt-in burn endpoints for manual sinks.

See `contracts/game/src/contract.rs` for the Soroban API surface (mixing, upgrades, market, rewards, events, limits, burns) and consult the Rust tests under each crate for sample usage.
