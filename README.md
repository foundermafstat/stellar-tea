# **Stellar Tea — Play-to-Earn Tea Blending Game on Stellar Blockchain**

## **Executive Summary**

**Stellar Tea** is a blockchain-based play-to-earn game built on the Stellar network using Soroban smart contracts.
It combines collaborative NFT crafting, dual-token economy, and gamified progression mechanics to create a social gaming experience where players mint tea NFTs, blend them into rare collectibles, and trade on an integrated marketplace.

---

## **Project Overview**

Stellar Tea orchestrates every asset, reward, and liquidity event through audited Soroban smart contracts, while a production-grade Next.js frontend delivers instant wallet connectivity, deterministic NFT rendering, and collaborative game flows.

The platform converts cooperative NFT crafting into monetizable network effects where players:

* Mint flavor-forward tea NFTs
* Fuse them into rarity-defining collectibles
* Accelerate progression through dual-token sinks
* Trade on a fee-engineered marketplace that compounds treasury growth and burns supply in real-time

---

## **Architecture**

### **Smart Contract Suite**

The project consists of five main Soroban smart contracts organized in a workspace structure:

---

### **1. StellarTeaGame Contract (`contracts/game`)**

The core game contract orchestrating all gameplay mechanics and maintaining a schema-driven catalog of recipes.

#### **Key Modules**

* **Mixing System:** Handles collaborative tea blending offers and execution
* **Marketplace:** Manages NFT listings and sales with fee structure
* **Rewards:** Daily claims and event-based reward distribution
* **Limits:** Rate limiting for daily actions and emissions
* **Configuration:** Recipe and game parameter management

#### **Economic Parameters**

* Market Fee: **3%** on all marketplace transactions
* Burn Rate: **2%** of marketplace fees are burned
* Daily Rewards: **0.02 BALLS** and **0.002 STARS** per claim
* Loser Compensation: **80%** of losing party’s fee returned in mixing

---

### **2. TeaNftContract (`contracts/nft-tea`)**

An enumerable and burnable NFT collection with rich metadata for tea characteristics.

#### **Features**

* Immutable provenance with lineage tracking
* Role-based admin/operator governance model
* Sequential minting for predictable token IDs
* Metadata includes: name, flavor profile, rarity, level, stats, lineage, image URI

---

### **3. Fungible Tokens**

#### **BALLS (Bubbles)**

* Utility token with 8 decimals
* Initial supply: **100,000,000,000** tokens
* Used for daily actions, mixing, upgrades, and marketplace trades
* Deflationary through burn mechanisms across gameplay

#### **STARS**

* Premium token with 8 decimals
* Initial supply: **10,000,000,000** tokens
* Powers high-rarity mixes, premium listings, and event stakes
* Convertible to XLM via swap contract

---

### **4. Swap Contract (`contracts/swap`)**

Provides XLM-to-STARS conversion with programmable treasury routing.

#### **Functionality**

* Accepts authenticated XLM deposits
* Transfers XLM to treasury-managed address
* Mints STARS tokens for recipients
* Configurable admin controls

---

### **Contract Dependencies**

All contracts use **OpenZeppelin Stellar** libraries for secure token implementations.

## **Game Mechanics**

### **1. Tea Minting**

Players mint new tea NFTs by:

1. Paying **150 STARS** to the tea contract
2. Browser generates unique tea with random layers and flavor profiles
3. Image and metadata uploaded to IPFS (Filebase)
4. On-chain NFT minted with metadata reference

---

### **2. Tea Mixing (Fusion)**

The core social gameplay mechanic where two players collaborate to create a new, upgraded tea.

#### **Workflow**

1. **Create Mix Offer** — Player A locks their tea NFT and specifies:

   * Desired flavor profile for partner’s tea
   * Minimum rank requirement
   * Recipe to create
   * Token fees (BALLS/STARS)

2. **Accept Offer** — Player B locks their tea NFT with matching fees

3. **Execute Mix** — Contract automatically:

   * Burns both input NFTs
   * Determines winner/loser randomly
   * Mints new fusion tea with recorded lineage
   * Distributes fees (winner keeps proceeds, loser gets 80%, 20% to treasury)
   * Updates metadata with parent lineage

---

### **3. Tea Upgrades**

Players can level up existing tea NFTs:

* Consume STARS/BALLS tokens
* Increase level by 1
* 50% burned, 50% sent to treasury
* Metadata updated

---

### **4. Marketplace**

Custodial marketplace for trading tea NFTs.

#### **Features**

* List NFTs priced in BALLS or STARS
* Automatic escrow handling
* 3% protocol fee on sales
* 2% burned, 1% to treasury
* Instant fulfillment

---

### **5. Daily Rewards**

Retention mechanic with rate-limited claiming:

* Players claim daily rewards of **0.02 BALLS + 0.002 STARS**
* Enforced through ledger-backed rate limits

---

### **6. Event Staking**

Seasonal engagement mechanic:

* Organizer-led staking pools
* 10% burned automatically
* Remaining 90% distributed among participants

---

## **Tokenomics**

### **Dual-Token Model**

#### **BALLS (Utility Token)**

* Total Supply: **100,000,000,000**
* Used for daily gameplay, basic mixing, and marketplace
* Deflationary via burns from mixing, upgrades, and trades
* Earned through gameplay

#### **STARS (Premium Token)**

* Total Supply: **10,000,000,000**
* Used for premium actions and minting
* Convertible from XLM via swap
* Deflationary through burn mechanisms

---

### **Economic Flows**

#### **Sources (Token Generation)**

* Daily claims
* Initial treasury allocations
* STARS minting via XLM swap

#### **Sinks (Token Burning)**

* 50% of upgrade costs
* 2% of marketplace sales
* Mixing fees
* 10% of event stakes

#### **Treasury Revenue**

* 50% of upgrade costs
* 1% of marketplace sales
* 20% of mixing fees
* 90% of event stakes
